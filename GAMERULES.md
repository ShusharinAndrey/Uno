## Special Cards

* Draw 2 Card
When you play this card, the next person to play must draw 2 cards and forfeit his/her turn.

If this card is turned up at the beginning of play, the first player must draw two cards. 
This card may only be played on a matching color or on another Draw 2 card.

* Reverse Card
This card reverses direction of play.
Play to the left now passes to the right, and vice versa. 
  
If this card is turned up at the beginning of play, the player to the right now plays first,
and play then goes to the right instead of left.

This card may only be played on a matching color or on another Reverse card.

* Skip Card
The next person in line to play after this card is played loses his/her turn and is "skipped".

If this card is turned up at the beginning of play,
the first player (the player to the left of the dealer) is skipped.

This card may only be played on a matching color or on another Skip card.

* Wild Card
When you play this card, you may change the color being played 
to any color (including the current color) to continue play. 
You may play a Wild card even if you have another playable card in hand.

If this card is turned up at the beginning of play, 
the person to the left of the dealer chooses the color to begin play and plays the first card.

Wild Draw 4 Card
This card allows you to call the next color played and 
requires the next player to pick 4 cards from the DRAW pile and forfeit his/her turn.

You can only play this card when you don't have a card in your hand
that matches the color of the card previously played. 
If turned up at the beginning of play, return this card to the deck and pick another card.

## Game Play
The players perform the actions of the card played by the previous player.
Then they lay down one of their cards corresponding to the color or value of the previous card.
